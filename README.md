# IsoFpd
community detection based on density-based clustering
this algorithm is based on Fdp clustering method
Codes for paper "A novel community detection method based on density clustering algorithm" by Tao You, Zhong-Yuan Zhang, 

To run the tests, just load the files and run demo.m in Matlab.

All codes are tested under Matlab Version 2015b, 64bit.

This document contains following files:

1.IsoFdp.m      	 //the main Codes of the proposed algorithm

2.IsomapII.m       	//faster version of isomap

3.dijkstra.mexw6	  //64bit compiled version of dijkstra algorithm which is much faster than the Floyd's algorithm

4.demo.m        	 //  show how to use the algorithm

5.LFR_data         	//  the synthetic dataset to test the algorithm

6.readme
